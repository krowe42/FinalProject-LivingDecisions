# uep239-FinalProject

## Summary

This short notebook is a preliminary attempt to understand my ideal neighborhood in Boston. Having lived in Somerville 
for half a year pre-Covid, I was interested to find out if there was in fact a more suitable area. I was most interested 
in the following variables, for the reasons below:  

- amount of impervious surface area
    - I'd like to live
- proximity to farmer's markets

- proximity to libraries
